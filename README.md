# Log-File-Error-Captures

I find the IP addresses which caused 400-like errors from a log file.

The file will need to be given as a parameter to this program. 

It works under the assumption that it is a conventional apache-log file. 

Feel free to modify the index of the comparator as per your convinience.

There are 2 versions of the code, one is  time-optimized and another is a repeated add-delete version.
